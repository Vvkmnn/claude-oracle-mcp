# Claude Oracle

Search 15,000+ tools before building from scratch.

## When to Use

**User asks about available tools**
- "Are there plugins for X?" → `search`
- "What MCP servers exist for Y?" → `search`
- "Do we have skills for Z?" → `browse`

**Before implementing**
- Starting new work → Check if tools exist first
- User mentions a need → Search before building
- Planning phase → Discover existing solutions

**Browsing options**
- Category search → `browse` with category
- Check all sources → `sources`

## Best Practice

Check oracle BEFORE:
- Building custom tools (existing ones may work)
- WebSearch for tools (oracle has 17 sources)
- Proposing implementation (tools might already solve it)
